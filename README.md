# Bayesian-Machine-Learning
- This folder keeps my personal course file (including homework and mid-term) for the Bayesian Models in Machine Learning Course. It was an awesome course offered by Columbia Engineering School.  
- Python codes are **deliberately erased** in compliance with Academic Integrity (you know assignments don't change that much :P) but if you are interested in how I impletemented the algorithms please contact me via E-mail: jz2673ds@gmail.com
