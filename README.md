# Bayesian-Machine-Learning
This folder keeps my personal course file (including homework and mid-term) for the Bayesian Models in Machine Learning Course. Python codes are deliberately erased in compliance with Academic Integrity (you know assignments don't change that much :)) but if you are interested in how I impletemented the algorithms please contact me via E-mail: jz2673ds@gmail.com
